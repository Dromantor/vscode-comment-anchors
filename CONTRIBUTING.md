## How to contribute to Comment-Anchors

Before anything else - make sure to install yarn for the project. Npm install -g yarn then yarn install to install all of its depdendenices. We do use yarn for the project which is required. 

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Comment-anchors](https://github.com/ExodiusStudios/vscode-comment-anchors/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, make sure to commit what you have patched/added. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit). 

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ExodiusStudios/vscode-comment-anchors/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ExodiusStudios/vscode-comment-anchors/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted (read more about [our rationales behind this decision](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700)).

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in our discord - (https://discord.gg/jCDCU2W) in #comment-anchors and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Comment Anchors in our discord - (https://discord.gg/jCDCU2W) in the channel #comment-anchors.
